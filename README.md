# CollectionBuilder-GH

> This `demo-site` branch of collectionbuilder-gh contains objects and metadata used to generate a demonstration version on GitHub Pages. 
> If starting a new project please use main/main branch instead.

A project to generate a free and simple digital collection site using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) given:

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPEG images, PDF documents, MP3s, or links to videos hosted on YouTube or Vimeo

Visit the [demo site](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/collectionbuilder-gh/).

## Build a Digital Collection

Gather your digital objects together and create your metadata using the [CollectionBuilder-GH Metadata Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Uv9ytll0hysMOH1j-VL1lZx6PWvc1zf3L35sK_4IuzI/copy) and [metadata docs](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/metadata/gh_metadata/). 

Then click the green "use this template" button to create your repository, and add your metadata and configure the repository to fit your collection and settings following the [CollectionBuilder Docs](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/). 

Please feel free to ask questions in the main [CollectionBuilder discussion forum](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder.github.io/discussions).

**Note:** 
Since CollectionBuilder-GH uses [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), it is only suitable for small collections, with lower resolution images. 
GitHub repositories are limited to 1GB.
For larger collections or those that require more customization, check out the [CollectionBuilder-CSV](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-csv) template.

## CollectionBuilder-GH Quick Tutorial

Follow the [CollectionBuilder-GH Walkthrough](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/walkthroughs/gh-walkthrough/) to set up a collection quickly using demo metadata and objects.

## Teaching and Learning with CollectionBuilder-GH

CollectionBuilder-GH is intended as a simple template for hands-on teaching about digital libraries.
It can be used in a workshop setting to take participants through digitization and metadata creation, to having a live collection site hosted on GitHub.

CollectionBuilder-GH aims to be well documented and easy to configure by following the documentation, with the potential to scaffold learning of a multitude of transferable digital and data skills.
A project in "minimal computing", it provides a depth of learning opportunities, allowing users to take complete ownership over the project and make their work open to the world.

Learn about:

- Git and GitHub basics
- [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), plaintext writing and content creation
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript literacy
- command line literacy
- GitHub collaboration and project management
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) basics
- working in the Open, open source and open data
- digital libraries concepts such as "collections as data", minimal computing, data-driven design

> We prefer commonly understood formats (such as CSV spreadsheets over YAML), and convention over configuration (follow the example over learn all the options).

## CollectionBuilder 

<https://collectionbuilder.github.io/>

CollectionBuilder is a project of University of Idaho Library's [Digital Initiatives](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/) and the [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu) (CDIL) following the [Lib-Static](https://lib-static.github.io/) methodology. 
Powered by the open source static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and a modern static web stack, it puts collection metadata to work building beautiful sites.

The basic theme is created using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
Metadata visualizations are built using open source libraries such as [DataTables](https://datatables.net/), [Leafletjs](http://leafletjs.com/), [Spotlight gallery](https://github.com/nextapps-de/spotlight), [lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes), and [Lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/).
Object metadata is exposed using [Schema.org](http://schema.org) and [Open Graph protocol](http://ogp.me/) standards.
