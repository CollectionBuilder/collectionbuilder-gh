# collectionbuilder-gh

A project to generate a free and simple digital collection site using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) given:

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPEG images or PDF documents

Click the green "use this template" button above to get started. Create your template repository, then add new metadata and configure the repository to fit your collection and settings.

See [Getting Started Docs](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/docs/introduction.html) for detailed information. **Note:** 
Since `collectionbuilder-gh` uses [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), it is only suitable for small collections, with lower resolution images. GitHub repositories are limited to 1GB.

## Demo CollectionBuilder with our Workshop Tutorial

If you'd like to demo CollectionBuilder, we've made [a step-through tutorial](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/workshop/gh/) using the following spreadsheet and zipped directory. (The tutorial uses items from our [Psychiana Digital Collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/psychiana/), which is worth a visit!)

Metadata is drawn from the following Google Sheet: 

- [Psychiana Digital Collection Metadata](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1x48Te3duPAxh53foEihQVKTfCKUjaCCbH7TrMMd_yU4)

Objects are collected in this zip file: 

- [Psychiana Digital Collection Media Files](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CPhNDv5FokC3utTCVmuXHS2OgnN9hR7q/view?usp=sharing) (Includes image files, pdfs, and mp3s)

These files are stored in this [CollectionBuilder-gh Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dTO8-3lusaKBdYyauyg_ziVqwLA4Fons?usp=sharing), along with some other metadata sheets and zipped object directories that can be used for other workshops and demonstrations.

## More on CollectionBuilder

`collectionbuilder-gh` is intended as a simple template for hands-on teaching about digital libraries.
It can be used in a workshop setting to take participants through digitization and metadata creation, to having a live collection site hosted on GitHub.

`collectionbuilder-gh` aims to be well documented and easy to configure by following the example, with the potential to scaffold learning of a multitude of transferable digital and data skills.
A project in "minimal computing", it provides a depth of learning opportunities, allowing users to take complete ownership over the project and make their work open to the world.

Learn about:

- Git and GitHub basics
- [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), plaintext writing and content creation
- HTML, CSS, and JS literacy
- commandline literacy
- GitHub collaboration and project management
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) basics
- working in the Open, open source and open data
- digital libraries concepts such as "collections as data", minimal computing, data-driven design

> We prefer commonly understood formats (such as CSV spreadsheets over YAML), and convention over configuration (follow the example over learn all the options).

## Features

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for GitHub Pages 
- Layout using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/).
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- Mapping using [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/)
- Tables using [DataTables](https://datatables.net/)
- Galleries using [lightGallery](http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/)
- Simple [lunr](https://lunrjs.com/) search 
- Rich markup using [Schema.org](http://schema.org) and [Open Graph protocol](http://ogp.me/) standards.
