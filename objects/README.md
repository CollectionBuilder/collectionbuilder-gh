# Objects Directory

Put your digital collection item's files in this folder!
By default, the CollectionBuilder-GH template looks for collection objects in this folder. 

This template comes with four demo objects as examples (.jpg, .pdf, and .mp3). 

CollectionBuilder-GH is designed for learning with small collections. 
Since you will be committing these objects into a GitHub repository, and there are no access derivatives generated, there is some limitations and guidelines to follow. 

**Guidelines:**

- Supported formats: jpeg, png, pdf, mp3 (also YouTube, but you won't have objects for those!)
- File size: since there is not thumbnails generated, keep your objects to a reasonable size for access on the web. This means you will usually not be using your full resolution versions! For example, jpeg images of about 1200px wide and PDFs less than 1 MB will work well. Larger images will slow load times.
- Total size: GitHub repositories have some limits on total size, some where around 1 GB. A good rule of thumb is to keep your "objects" folder less than 500 MB. 
- Filenaming: to avoid issues, please pay close attention to filenaming conventions! The filename should be a lowercase unique string with no spaces or special characters. Underscores (_) are okay; slashes (/) should NOT be used in this field. Use the exact filename to populate the "filename" field of your metadata.

**Note:** 
If you are building a larger collection or featuring larger objects, please look at using a different CollectionBuilder template that enables generating derivatives and hosting objects in a separate location.
CB-GH is great for learning and prototyping--all your configuration and metadata template is transferable to other CollectionBuilder templates.
