## About the About Page

We want to make engaging interpretive pages easier to create, so CollectionBuilder gives you tools to write *with* your collection content!

The template comes with a customizable "About" page layout designed for long form content with rich media embeds.
Content is written in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and enhanced using "includes" that pull in collection content, external media, and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) features like cards and modals.
We hope this makes it easier for site builders to develop the collection AND add interesting and engaging contextual information. 

Each "include" file has several options, which are documented in the files themselves--copy the examples to see how it works with your content! 
In the demo below, we've given display widths of 25% and 50% to save space, but you can feature the entire image or document.

You can also see a page featuring [a bonanza of feature includes options](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/collectionbuilder-gh/feature_options.html) on our CollectionBuilder-GH demo site. 

{% include feature/button.html text="Feature *Includes* Bonanza page" link="https://collectionbuilder.github.io/collectionbuilder-gh/feature_options.html" color="primary" size="lg" centered=true %}

### Include Collection Items

The template provides includes to pull your collection objects and metadata into your interpretive page, allowing you to write with your materials directly embedded in the content.

#### Include an Image

- Image --> `{% raw %}{% include feature/image.html objectid="demo_001" width="75" %}{% endraw %}`

{% include feature/image.html objectid=imagesampleid width="75" %}

#### Include a PDF

- PDF -- > `{% raw %}{% include feature/pdf.html objectid="demo_002"  width="50" %}{% endraw %}`

{% include feature/pdf.html objectid=pdfsampleid width="50" %}

#### Include a Video

- Video: `{% raw %}{% include feature/video.html objectid="demo_004" %}{% endraw %}`

{% include feature/video.html objectid=videosampleid width="75" %}

#### Include an Audio File

- Audio: `{% raw %}{% include feature/audio.html objectid="demo_003" %}{% endraw %}`

{% include feature/audio.html objectid=audiosampleid  %}

### Include Bootstrap Features

The template also provides includes to make it easier to add [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) components to your Markdown writing.
These features allow you to better organize and highlight your content.

#### Include a Card

#### Include a Button 

- Buttons -- > `{% raw %}{% include feature/button.html text="Button Link to Somewhere" link="https://collectionbuilder.github.io/" color="success" %}{% endraw %}`

#### Include an Alert

- Alerts -- > `{% raw %}{% include feature/alert.html text="this is an *alert* that 'warns' a user" color="warning" align="center" %}{% endraw %}`
