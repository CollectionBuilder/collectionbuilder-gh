# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

CollectionBuilder-CSV is a template repository used to start other projects. 
External projects are not automatically updated from the central template--security issues relating to existing projects *created with CollectionBuilder* should be reported to the individual repository/project owners.
Security issues found in the main branch of the current CollectionBuilder-CSV template and its assets should be reported to CollectionBuilder team directly.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue, please email <collectionbuilder.team@gmail.com> with a description of the issue, the steps you took to create the issue, affected versions, and, if known, mitigations for the issue. This project follows a 90 day disclosure timeline.
